# Yone visual QA

- [x] Same-ID visual replacement targets `dual_blader` (official project hero 009).
- [x] Actor canvas is exactly `3502x88`; all 13 native tags, frame counts, durations, rectangles, and insertion order are preserved.
- [x] `hit_effect_area` reuses the official `ult[1..11]` atlas rectangles without conflicting pixels.
- [x] Idle/run/attack/Q/W/R/dead bodies retain one stable battle scale.
- [x] The retired Yone body model was replaced end-to-end with four new ImageGen contact sheets (core, run, Q/W/R body and defeat); Q/W/R effect sheets remain unchanged.
- [x] Each complete body plate is rasterized once to a reviewed native 1x grid; all 54 visible body frames are copied byte-for-byte from the native master with no pack-time resize.
- [x] The new adult-proportioned natural 3/4 face preserves source-authored eye, jaw and hair clusters without any post-scale face repaint.
- [x] Idle/run/attack/hit keep the official Dual Blader bottom clearances, and the card/BP center camera is raised to y=-16 so legs and weapons keep a visible gap above the black divider.
- [x] Q3 uses a dedicated horizontal tornado, a vertical blue-white airborne cue, and a small ready-wind state.
- [x] Active champion data and release resources do not reference Soul Unbound. Exactly five retired Yone E names plus two retired Shen dash names remain registered only as no-op saved-season compatibility aliases.
- [x] W has no process-global ledger: one native callback scans only its current `GameCtx`, resolves an 80-degree forward cone, damages that snapshot, counts champion hits, and emits one shield tier marker.
- [x] W keeps Yone planted, plays one full caster-following crescent, and uses five generated WR sweep poses; no code-drawn body, arm or blade is added during packing.
- [x] Minions and monsters qualify for the base shield; every enemy champion hit increases its tier through the normal five-champion team limit.
- [x] W has no dash, spirit clone, anchor, tether, forced return, recall override, or teleport path.
- [x] Compact portrait is face-focused with transparent safety margins.
- [x] QA replays the user's exact idle[0] 2.2x nearest-neighbor actor path, compares all idle/run frames, rejects near-white face blocks, and preserves source foot/card-bottom clearances.
- [x] BP-grid portrait is full body and ends at `y<=86`, ten pixels above the native name band.
- [x] BP illustration is `1420x860`; the three active-slot icons are independent `64x64` assets.

Runtime effect IDs and sheet tags are recorded in `qa/yone_visual_contract.json`.
